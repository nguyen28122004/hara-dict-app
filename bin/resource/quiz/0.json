However, in this context, it conveys a negative sense, suggesting that having only a small number of friends makes life worth living. This is not the intended meaning of the sentence.\nOption B: a few\n\"A few\" means a small number but conveys a more positive sense than \"few.\" It suggests that having some friends, even if it's not a large number, makes life worth living. This aligns with the intended meaning of the sentence.\nOption C: little\n\"Little\" is typically used to describe a small quantity of uncountable nouns and is not suitable in this context. It doesn't convey the idea of having friends.\nOption D: a little\n\"A little\" is also used with uncountable nouns to describe a small quantity. Like option C, it is not appropriate in this context.\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option B: a few. It is the most suitable choice to convey the idea that having some good friends in life makes life worth living."
