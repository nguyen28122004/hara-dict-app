Hence, this phrase should be preceded by the definite article 'the'.\nThe word, 'spider' is a common noun. In the given sentence, it does not refer to any specific spider. Hence, an indefinite article ('a' or 'an') is to be used before this word. As the word, 'spider' starts with a consonant sound, the article 'a' is to be used before it.\nThe word cave is preceded by the definite article 'the'. Hence, we know that it refers to a specific cave. The ceiling of such a specific cave should also refer to a specific ceiling. Hence, the noun phrase, 'ceiling of the cave' should be preceded by the definite article, 'the'. Option A indicates this correctly and is the correct answer."

'Morning walk' is mentioned as one of them. As it refers to 'one of many' tonics, an indefinite article is used before the word, 'tonic'. The word 'exercise' is also used similarly. So, before the words, 'tonic' and 'exercise', an indefinite article is to be used.\nThe choice between the indefinite articles, 'a' and 'an' is determined by the sound. Before a word beginning with a vowel sound, 'an' is used. Before a word beginning with a consonant sound, 'a' is used. The noun, 'tonic' begins with a consonant sound 't'. The noun 'exercise' begins with a vowel sound, 'e'. Hence, we use 'a' before 'tonic' (a tonic) and 'an' before 'exercise' (an exercise).\nThe words, 'weak' and 'healthy' are adjectives. However, they are also sometimes used as nouns to refer to the entire class of people who are 'weak' and 'healthy' respectively. Hence, the definite article, 'the' is used before both these nouns."
