The usage of \"phoned\" in the past tense accurately conveys the idea that the action was performed, even though it did not yield the intended result due to the phone's malfunction.\nOption A: would phone\nThis option is incorrect. \"Would phone\" is not suitable in this context, as it implies a hypothetical or conditional action, rather than a past attempt to call.\nOption C: were going to phone\nThis option is incorrect. \"Were going to phone\" indicates an intention in the past, but it does not convey that the actual action of phoning took place.\nOption D: did phone\nThis option is incorrect. \"Did phone\" is grammatically correct, but it does not capture the fact that the attempt to phone was unsuccessful due to the phone being out of order.\nOption E: didn't phone\nThis option is incorrect. \"Didn't phone\" implies that no attempt to call was made, which contradicts the context of the sentence where the speaker tried to call but couldn't due to the phone being out of order.\nThe correct answer is Option B: phoned, as it accurately represents the past action of attempting to call someone, despite the unsuccessful outcome due to the malfunctioning phone."

The second blank requires the present simple tense, \"includes,\" to indicate the current and continuous state of the network of concentration camps. \nOption D: maintains/includes accurately conveys the ongoing nature of the actions and the current situation as described in the sentence. \nIn Option A, \"was maintaining\" (past continuous) is not suitable for the first blank because it does not convey the present and ongoing action. \"Has included\" (present perfect) is not appropriate for the second blank because it does not convey the current state of the concentration camps. \nIn Option B, \"had maintained\" (past perfect) is not suitable for the first blank because it does not convey the present and ongoing action. \"Would include\" (conditional) is not appropriate for the second blank because it does not convey the current state of the concentration camps. \nIn Option C, \"is maintaining\" (present continuous) is suitable for the first blank, but \"had included\" (past perfect) is not appropriate for the second blank because it does not convey the current state of the concentration camps. \nIn Option E, \"maintained\" (past simple) is not suitable for the ongoing situation described in the sentence. \"Will include\" (future simple) is not appropriate for the second blank because it does not convey the current state of the concentration camps. \nThe correct answer is Option D: maintains/includes, which accurately conveys the present and ongoing nature of the actions and the current situation as described in the sentence."

This form of the future tense is commonly used to express beliefs or expectations about future events.\nNow, let's examine why the other options are incorrect:\nOption B: is coming\nThis option uses the present continuous tense, which indicates an action that is happening at the moment or around the present time. However, the sentence is discussing a future event (Sue's attendance at the party), so the present continuous tense is not suitable here.\nOption C: have come\nThis option uses the present perfect tense, which typically indicates an action that happened at an unspecified time before the present. However, the sentence is about a future event, so the present perfect tense is not appropriate in this context.\nOption D: came\nThis option uses the simple past tense, which refers to an action that occurred and was completed in the past. Since the sentence is discussing a future event (Sue's potential attendance at the party), the simple past tense is not the correct choice.\nIn summary, the correct answer is Option A: will come because it accurately conveys the future action of Sue's attendance at the party. The other options use tenses that are not suitable for discussing a future event in this context."
